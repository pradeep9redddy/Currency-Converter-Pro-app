# Currency-Converter-Pro-app
This android app converts the currency and has a features to add the conversion to favorite's and can delete that conversion just by clicking on that particular conversion.


I had used a 3rd party API to convert the currency and SQLite Database to store the favorite conversion data in local storage.

This is the logo which will appear while starting of the app.
